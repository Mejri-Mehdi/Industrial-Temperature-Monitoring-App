Industrial Motor Temperature Monitoring App 🚀

An Android mobile application built with Kotlin that enables real-time monitoring of temperature data across multiple motors and rooms in industrial settings. This app is designed to keep workers updated, improve safety, and prevent equipment damage by sending alerts when temperature thresholds are exceeded.

🌟 Features

Real-Time Temperature Monitoring – Collects data from multiple motors and rooms continuously.

Instant Alerts – Sends notifications when a motor or room exceeds predefined temperature thresholds.

Remote Updates – Workers and managers stay informed even from a distance.

Database Integration – Stores all collected data in a MySQL database for analysis and reporting.

User-Friendly Interface – Intuitive Android interface built with Kotlin.

📊 How It Works

Sensors attached to motors and rooms send temperature data.

The app collects the data in real-time.

Thresholds are monitored automatically.

If temperature exceeds limits, alerts are sent immediately to the user.

All data is logged in a MySQL database for historical tracking and analysis.
